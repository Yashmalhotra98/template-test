// Our browser window is represented by window in JS by default all JS is in our window element. 
// Within the window object, we have a console object which allows us to `log` our data in the in the browser window. 
//  This is helpful in many ways but the most important is that it allows us to see the data in the browser window.
//  FOr ex if  we call an API and we get back some data, we can log that data to the browser window.
